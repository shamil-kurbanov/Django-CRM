The CRM system should allow employees to:

- Keep track of services offered by the company.
- Launch and complete advertising campaigns.
- Keep track of potential customers interested in specific advertising campaigns.
- Transition customers from "potential" status to "active" status when drafting cooperation contracts.

This CRM system should have several categories of users with specific roles:

- Administrator: creates users and assigns roles.
- Operator: creates records of potential clients.
- Marketer: creates records of services provided and ongoing advertising campaigns.
- Manager: works with potential clients, creates contracts, and transitions potential clients to active status.

The CRM system should also calculate the statistics of the success of advertising campaigns conducted by the organization. The system needs to consider several factors:

- The number of potential customers interested in the advertisement.
- The number of customer transitions from potential to active.
- Sales volumes per customer.

Why This Task Is Important for the Client:
The CRM system you develop will allow the client to efficiently manage the process of working with customers, track the effectiveness of advertising campaigns, and increase overall business productivity.

Additionally, with CRM, the client will be able to systematize the work of employees from different cities and regions.

Calculation and display of statistics on advertising campaigns: how many potential clients were attracted and how many of them transitioned to active status.

Pages for Working with Services:
Page displaying a list of active clients: each entry should have a unique identifier, for example, a name. Entries should be links to detailed pages. Buttons for deletion should be added next to them, and a general button for creating a new entry should be on the page.
The detailed page should have an immutable form with data about the entry, as well as a button for editing and deleting the entry.
The editing page should be pre-filled and available for editing.
The creation page should have an empty form for filling in.

Pages for Working with Advertising Campaigns:
Similar to pages for working with services.

Pages for Working with Potential Clients:
Similar to pages for working with services.
Next to each entry on the list page, there should be a link to transition a potential client to active. This allows the user to transition to the page for creating an active client.

Pages for Working with Contracts:
Similar to pages for working with services.

Pages for Working with Active Clients:
Page displaying a list of active clients: each entry should have a unique identifier, for example, a name. Entries should be links to detailed pages. Buttons for deletion should be added next to them.
The detailed page should have an immutable form with data about the entry, as well as a button for editing and deleting the entry.
The editing page should be pre-filled and available for editing.
The creation page should have the potential client field pre-filled, while the others should be empty.

User Roles:
The system should have predefined user roles.

Administrator can create, view, and edit users, assign roles and permissions. This functionality will be implemented in the Django administrative panel.
Operator can create, view, and edit potential clients.
Marketer can create, view, and edit provided services and advertising campaigns.

Code Requirements:
Users and roles should be created using the standard Django administrative interface.
All other CRM system functions should be accessible outside the Django administrative interface.
PostgreSQL should be used as the database management system (DBMS).
Pylint should be connected to automatically check the code for compliance with style formatting. For more information on this, read the instructions for using Pylint.
